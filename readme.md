## Playground Evaluator

This project provides a minimal, extensible framework for evaluating mathematical expressions in TypeScript. It is
intended as a starting point for adding further functionality to the evaluator.

### Project Structure

-   **src/types.ts**: Defines the core types and interfaces for expressions and evaluation results, including `Sum`,
    `Multiply`, `Negate`, `Divide`, and `Constant`.
-   **src/evaluate.ts**: Contains the main logic for evaluating expressions based on their type. Supports sum,
    multiplication, negation, and division.

-   **formula.test.ts**: Test suite using Vitest to verify the correctness of the evaluator for various operations.

### Purpose

This repository is meant as a starting point to add further functionality to the evaluator.

Issue #1 has some ideas for what we could do.
